<h4>What is the Maronite Church?</h4>
<p>
The Maronite Church is one of 22 churches within the one universal Catholic Church. A Church is a community of faith having a distinct tradition, theology, spirituality, liturgy, hierarchy, and canon law. At the same time, each church enjoys an autonomy and independence from its sister churches. All of the churches are united in the same profession of Faith, in the same celebration of the Sacraments, and in the same hierarchal unity. Under the Pope, the different traditions evolved from five centers of Christianity where the apostles preached -- Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople, Rome and Jerusalem.

The Maronite Church evolved from the Antiochene tradition in the 5th century. The first Maronites were direct descendants of the people who had received the Faith from the Apostle, Peter. The father of the Maronite Church was a holy monk and hermit, Maron, who lived from 350-410 AD. Maron's life was one of piety and dedication to the simple life of prayer and meditation; his holiness attracted many to join him and to convert others to Christianity through the spreading of the Gospel. St. John Maron, the first Patriarch of the Maronite people. The Maronite Patriarchate was initiated by the election of John Maron in 686 AD and has continued, to the present.

Late in the seventh century, due to religious persecution and heresy, the Maronite monks became obliged to seek refuge in Lebanon, where St. Maron's relics were transferred to the Patriarchal residence in Kafarhai. In the year 1130, they were removed to Foligno, Italy, and placed in the Cathedral there. In January, 2000, the relics were returned to Lebanon.

The Maronite tradition was brought to the United States in the early 1900's with the immigration of many Maronites from Lebanon. A hierarchy was established for the Maronites of the USA in 1965, and in 1972 the Diocese of St. Maron was established with the See in Detroit, Michigan. The first Bishop was Archbishop Francis M. Zayek. In 1994, the Diocese (Eparchy) of Our Lady of Lebanon was established with its See in Los Angeles. There are over 54 Maronite parishes and several missions in the United States.

The Maronite Church professes the same faith and beliefs of the One, Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. It also administers the 7 Sacraments instituted by Christ, and obeys all the moral and dogmatic norms issued by our Holy Father the Pope, the successor of Saint Peter in the Vatican. The liturgy, itself, is known as the Syriac liturgy of Antioch, ascribed to St. James the Less, "brother of the Lord", Apostle and first Bishop of Jerusalem. The ritual formulation expresses the spirit of Eastern monasticism. The liturgical language used in the Maronite Mass is Syriac-Aramaic, the language spoken by Christ. Incense is used during the Liturgy to signify that our prayers go heavenward to God as the sweet-smelling smoke of incense rises up. In the Liturgy, the words of consecration are traditionally chanted in Aramaic, the same language our Lord spoke. Communion is received by intinction, after the priest dips the Host in the Chalice. This is the only form prescribed for reception of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Maronite Church. Maronites cultivate profound adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, seeing in the Holy Eucharist the Risen Christ who sent to us the Sanctifying Spirit. They are also deeply devoted to Mary, The Mother of the Light, hailing her strength and fidelity in the title of "Cedar of Lebanon."
